In Short:
---------

S: Single Responsibility Principle.	|	SRP	
O: Open Closed Principle.			|	OCP	
L: Liskov Substitution Principle.	|	LSP	
I: Interface Segregation Principle.	|	ISP	
D: Dependency Inversion Principle.	|	DIP

SRP: A Class should have one, and only one, reason to change
OCP: You should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.
LSP: Derived class must be substituted for their base class.
ISP: Make find grained interfaces that are client specific. Not Fat or Polluted.
DIP: Depends on Abstraction and not concrete implementation.
