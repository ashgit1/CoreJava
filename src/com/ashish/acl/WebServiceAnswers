REST:
=====

Ans 1:
------

RESTless means not restful. If you have a web app that does not adhere to RESTful principles then it is not RESTful. ex: SOAP.
Restful : Must adhere to RestFul principles. Like no protocol dependent, resources identified by address, no specification like wsdl
in soap.
In restful model resource is identified by URL (NOUN) and the actions(VERBS) by the predefined methods in HTTP protocols 
i.e. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.

Ans 2:

I used Jersey framework and JAX-RX api for implementing REST.

Asn3:
-----

Query parameters are added to the url after the ? mark, while a path parameter is part of the regular URL separated by '/'.

In the URL below tom could be the value of a path parameter and there is one query parameter with the name id and value 1:

http://mydomain.com/tom?id=1

When to use Query parameter or Path Parameter ?

If there is a scenario to retrieve a record based on id, for example you need to get the details of the employee whose id is 15, 
then you can have resource with @PathParam.
GET /employee/{id}

If there is a scenario where you need to get the details of all employees but only 10 at a time, you may use query param

GET /employee?start=1&size=10

This says that starting employee id 1 get ten records.

To summarize, 
use @PathParam for retrieval based on id. 
Use @QueryParam for filter or if you have any fixed list of options that user can pass.
