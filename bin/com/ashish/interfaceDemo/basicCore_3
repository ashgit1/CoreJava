Interface:
----------

The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve fully abstraction
Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.

It is used to achieve fully abstraction.
By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

Imp:
----
methods are public and abstract.
fields are public, static and final.

Multiple Inheritance through class. ex: TestTnterface1.java
Multiple Inheritance through Interface. ex: TestTnterface2.java

Q) What is marker or tagged interface?

An interface that have no member is known as marker or tagged interface. 
For example: Serializable, Cloneable, Remote etc. They are used to provide some essential information to the 
JVM so that JVM may perform some useful operation.

Package:
--------

The standard of defining package is domain.company.package e.g. com.javatpoint.bean or org.sssit.dao.

Rule: There can be only one public class in a java source file and it must be saved by the public class name.

Package Class:
--------------
The package class provides methods to get information about the specification and implementation of a package. 
It provides methods such as getName(), getImplementationTitle(), getImplementationVendor(), getImplementationVersion() etc

Clone Object:
-------------

The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object. For this purpose, clone() method of Object class is 
used to clone an object.
The java.lang.Cloneable interface must be implemented by the class whose object clone we want to create. 
If we don't implement Cloneable interface, clone() method generates CloneNotSupportedException.
The clone() method saves the extra processing task for creating the exact copy of an object.

syntax: protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

ex: Student18.java

Array:
------

What is the class name of java array?

In java, array is an object. For array object, an proxy class is created whose name can be obtained by 
getClass().getName() method on the object.

ex: ArrayDemo.java

Copying a java array:
---------------------

We can copy an array to another by the arraycopy method of System class.


Call by Value and Call by Reference in Java:
--------------------------------------------

There is only call by value in java, not call by reference. 
If we call a method passing a value, it is known as call by value. 
The changes being done in the called method, is not affected in the calling method.

ex: Operation.java

In case of call by reference original value is changed if we made changes in the called method. 
If we pass object in place of any primitive value, original value will be changed.

ex: Operation2.java

Java Strictfp Keyword:
----------------------

Java strictfp keyword ensures that you will get the same result on every platform if you perform operations 
in the floating-point variable. 
The precision may differ from platform to platform that is why java programming language have provided the 
strictfp keyword, so that you get same result on every platform. 
So, now you have better control over the floating-point arithmetic.

(*) The strictfp keyword can be applied on methods, classes and interfaces.
(*) The strictfp keyword cannot be applied on abstract methods, variables or constructors.

Creating API Document | javadoc tool:
-------------------------------------

We can create document api in java by the help of javadoc tool. 
In the java file, we must use the documentation comment /**... */ to post information for the 
class, method, constructor, fields etc.

To create the document API, you need to use the javadoc tool followed by java file name. 
There is no need to compile the javafile. 
ex: javadoc DocumentAPI.java
There will be created a lot of html files. 
Open the index.html file to get the information about the classes

Java Command Line Arguments:
----------------------------

The java command-line argument is an argument i.e. passed at the time of running the java program.

ex: CommandLine1.java, CommandLine2.java
